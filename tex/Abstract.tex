\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent This Project Work on Information Security focuses on regulating personal data disclosure among third parties, providing a simple implementation within the Android framework. To increase their privacy, data owners can purposefully create \textit{Sticky Policies}, metadata to describe which users or services can access the personal information they stick to.

First, we describe the state of the art in terms of literature and existing algorithms for \textit{Sticky Policy} implementation; then, we analyze the available concrete solutions and their weaknesses. Finally, we present our solution and its features, including considerations about future improvements.

In the last chapter, we show performance measurements and comparisons to support our work and decisions.
