\noindent We have presented a project work on Information Security in which we tackle the matter of privacy and personal data sharing on mobile devices. In this context, we provide a tool control how data is shared in terms of recipients and scope of use: by implementing \textit{Sticky Policies} it is possible to describe detailed and fine-grained constraints for each shared file. \textit{Sticky Policies} are metadata that sticks to the data they describe through the application of cryptographic processes, and provided that third parties are trusted and will not illicitly share personal data with others, \textit{Sticky Policies} will always travel together with the data they refer to.

To obtain data access, third parties must ask a Trusted Authority and may be subject to its examination, aimed at assessing the service's reliability.

In this work, we have implemented both a data owner and a data consumer, who communicate through an Android device application; the Trusted Authority is represented by a web server in Java, which exposes the aforementioned functionalities on Java servlets.

Let us now observe the performance of the StickyPoliciesApp using the Android Profiler available within Android Studio. The Android Profiler shows CPU, memory and network usage with the passing of time, but can be used only if the Android OS is 5.0 or higher (Lollipop): thus, it is not possible to test the application on a concrete device and we will just show results regarding the Android emulator.

Our first experiment is very simple: we suppose Alice wants to share a very short string of data. We test the application using as input \texttt{I cheated during last exam} (which counts 5 words and 26 characters), a string so simple that it could be the data owner Social Security Number, credit card number and pin, or Netflix username and password. As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:performance-5words}, we have two network usage peaks both in download and upload (avg speed 5KB/s) which match certificate sharing between client and server, followed by a higher peak corresponding to Alice sharing her encrypted data to Bob (avg speed 20KB/s UL, 3KB/s DL) and him asking the Trusted Authority to be granted access.

For what concerns CPU usage, we have three main peaks of duration lower than a second and occupation between 30\% and 50\%. The memory is mainly allocated for code and java usage, and it goes from 9MB at the instantiation of \texttt{MainActivity} to 32MB when \texttt{AccessDataActivity} terminates.

Next, we slightly increase the difficulty of the experiment, sharing a text document of 101 words and 605 characters. Network usage is equally divided in two moments of comparable magnitude: approximately 5KB/s in DL and UL followed by 17KB/s in UL and 2KB/s in DL. Memory usage has increased of about 10MB from the previous experiment, similarly divided between Java and code memory usage. CPU bursts have increased in number, but the percentage is usually around 25\% and the timespan of each burst is approximately 10 ms long; three main bursts are still present. Graphs from the Android Profiler are shown in Figure \ref{fig:performance-100words}.

Finally, we share a text with 1000 words (for a total count of 6804 characters): as we can observe from Figure \ref{fig:performance-1000words}, network usage radically increase, transmitting up to 91.8KB/s UL, 4KB/s DL when sharing data between Alice and Bob - this communication takes about 20 ms.Memory usage increases linearly, starting from 20MB at the instantiation to 37MB when the last activity stops. We can observe also more frequent CPU bursts: on average, the intensity has little increase in percentage, but the highest peaks reach up to 60\% even though they last less than a second.
